      Goal:  
      By 2030, help poor and vulnerable people survive disasters like floods, storms, droughts, economic crashes, 
      and social problems without their lives falling apart.
      Basically:
      Make sure the people who already have the least don’t get hit the hardest when bad stuff happens.

    <h1>Research</h1>
    <hr>
    <ul>
    <h3>Global Impact</h3>
    <li>Over 3.3–3.6 billion people live in places highly vulnerable to climate change (IPCC, 2022).</li>
    <br>
    <li>90% of disaster‑related deaths occur in low‑ and middle‑income countries (UNDRR, 2023).</li>
    <br>
    <li>From 2000–2019, disasters affected 4 billion people and caused $2.97 trillion in economic losses (UNDRR).</li>
    <hr>
    <h3>Poverty + Vulnerability</h3>
    <li>People living in poverty are up to 7 times more likely to die in disasters than wealthy populations.</li>
    <br>
    <li>1 in 3 urban residents in developing countries lives in slums or unsafe housing, increasing risk during floods and storms.</li>
    <hr>
    <h3>Climate‑Related Disasters</h3>
    <li>Climate‑related disasters (floods, storms, droughts) have increased by 83% in the last 20 years.</li>
    <br>
    <li>Floods alone affected 1.65 billion people between 2000–2019.</li>
    <hr>
    <h3>Economic Losses</h3>
    <li>In 2022, disasters caused $275 billion in global economic losses (Swiss Re Institute).</li>
    <br>
    <li>Low‑income countries lose a larger share of their economy, sometimes over 10% of GDP from a single disaster.</li>
    </ul>

<section id="Assistance" class="section container">
  <div class="boxes">
    <h1>Assistance</h1>
    <p>We can help vulnerable communities by giving them the support they need before, during, and after disasters. This includes providing emergency supplies like food, clean water, blankets, and medical care right away so people can stay safe. We can also raise money to help families rebuild their homes, replace lost belongings, and restart their jobs or small businesses. Another way to help is by rebuilding schools, hospitals, and roads so the community can return to normal. We can also teach people safety skills, help farmers recover their crops, and make sure everyone has support until they can fully recover. Basically, assistance means giving people what they need to survive the disaster and helping them rebuild their lives afterward.</p>
